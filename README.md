# A Spotify like HTML5 player

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeremyrajan/spotifyLike.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeremyrajan/spotifyLike)

This is a Spotify 'Like' player that we started, just for fun :). We are trying to incorporate a similar looking front-end like Spotify. The advantage here being, you just have to pass a JSON object with a structure and the player will take care of it. Checkout the source, till we release a documentation.

***Please note that, this is still Work in Progess and could be buggy.***
